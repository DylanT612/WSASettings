        <h2>What is P.O.U.R.?</h2>
            <p>
                P.O.U.R. stands for <b>P</b>erceivable, <b>O</b>perable, 
                <b>U</b>nderstandable, and <b>R</b>obust. 
                These are a set of principles that guide the design and 
                development of accessible websites. The goal of POUR is to 
                make a website accessible to all users, regardless of 
                disabilities. An explanation of the acronym is as follows:
                perceive meaning that all information on the site can be 
                perceivable by users.Operate, meaning that all functionality 
                on the website should be operable with just a keyboard or 
                other input device. Understandable meaning that all users 
                can easy understand the content. Robust means that the 
                content and functionality of a web site should be compatible 
                with current and future technologies.

            <p><!-- Explaing how we made it more accessible -->
                This table shows all the principles of POUR. The table 
                showcases perceivable by making it visually and auditory 
                accesssible to users with a wide range of sensory abilities.
                It also uses aria-label and caption elements to provide a 
                clear and concise label for the table making it easy to 
                comprehend what the table represents. using thead and tbody 
                elements help group the content of the table making it 
                easier to structurally understand. We also demonstrated the 
                operable principle by making the table navigable using 
                standard keyboard controls. We used the scope attribute in 
                the th elements that allows users to to understand the 
                relationships which make it easier to navigate the table. 
                Another principle demonstrated is understandable. the caption 
                and the aria-label attribute provide a clear and concise 
                label for the table making the table much easier to 
                understand. The scope and th elements allows users to 
                understand the relationship between the header cells and 
                data cells in the table which can make it easier to 
                understand the data in the table. We also demonstrated the 
                robust principal. The table was created using standard HTML 
                markup, making it accessible to a wide range of browsers 
                and assistive technologies. As well as using the role 
                attribute to indicate that the element is a table which can 
                help assistive technologies understand the structure of 
                the table.

        <p><!-- Explaining how it is accessible -->
            This example demonstrates the perceivable and operable 
            principles in POUR. We used semantic language in the markup 
            and used descriptive labels for each form field to ensure 
            the form is easy to navigate for screen readers and other 
            assistive technologies. For the operable principle in POUR we 
            ensured the form can be navigated using the keyboard alone 
            without the need for a mouse. We provided clear error messages 
            and avoided using placeholders which can create confusion.

        <h2>Making Images Accessible</h2>
        <img src="images/image1.png" alt="The human eye close up">
        <p>
            Here we demonstrate how we use the alt tag on an image 
            to explain to the user the picture if the image fails 
            to show up or if the user has trouble seeing properly. 
            This demonstrates the perceivable principle in POUR.
